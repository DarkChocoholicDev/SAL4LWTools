# SAL4LWTools
6809/6309 Structured Assembly Language translator, targeting the LWTools assembler and linker.

This tool takes structured assembly language source files (for the 6809/6309 microprocessor) and translates them for use as input to
the LWTools assembler/linker tool chain. The SAL source files consist of assembly language instructions written in a C-language-like
manner, combining the readability and ease-of-expression of a C-based language with the low-level control and performance of
traditional assembly language.
